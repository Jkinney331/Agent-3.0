git commit -m "🎨 MAJOR UPDATE: Cursor-Style Dashboard + Real Data Fixes

✅ Fixed Fake Data Issues:
- Trading Activity: Replaced hardcoded fake trades with real Supabase orders
- Portfolio Metrics: Already fixed to show real $50k account balance
- Real-time data fetching with proper fallbacks for fresh accounts

🎨 Cursor-Style Right Panel:
- Three modes: Auto, Ask, Agent (just like Cursor!)
- Auto Mode: Watch AI autonomously analyze markets and make decisions
- Ask Mode: Interactive Q&A about trading, balance, strategies
- Agent Mode: Give commands for specific trading tasks

🧠 AI Thinking Visualization:
- Step-by-step process visualization for every trade decision
- Market Data Collection → Technical Analysis → Risk Assessment → Execution
- Real-time confidence scores and detailed reasoning
- Visual progress indicators with animated icons

🔥 Enhanced Features:
- Real $50k account data (no more fake $116k portfolio)
- Live order tracking from Supabase database
- Intelligent chat responses based on actual account status
- Auto-trading simulation with realistic decision making
- Quick action buttons for common questions

📱 UI/UX Improvements:
- Full-height right panel (like Cursor's chat panel)
- Responsive dashboard layout that works on all screens
- Smooth scrolling and message animations
- Professional trading interface design

🛡️ Error Handling:
- Graceful fallbacks when APIs are unavailable
- Clear messaging for fresh accounts with no trading history
- Loading states and error indicators
- Real-time data refresh every 15-30 seconds

This transforms the dashboard into a professional AI trading interface
where users can watch their AI agent think through every trading decision!"
